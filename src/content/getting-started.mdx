# Getting Started

## Installation

As there are a few steps needed to get it running, it's not recommended to do this manually, instead use the e[xisting template to get started](https://github.com/barelyhuman/adex-default-template)

If you still wish to set it up manually.

- Create a preact based vite app

```sh
npm create vite@latest -- -t preact
```

- Add in the required deps

```sh
npm add -D adex
```

- Modify config to use adex

```diff
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import preact from '@preact/preset-vite'
+ import { adex } from 'adex'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
+   adex(),
    preact()],
})
```

- Remove the default preact files and add in basic structure for adex

```sh
rm -rf ./src/\* index.html
mkdir -p src/pages src/api
touch src/global.css
```

## Folder Structure

After the setup, you should see this basic folder structure.

```sh
public # -> Public assets
src  # -> source files
--- pages
------ hello.js # -> Route binding for `/hello`
--- api
------ hello.js # -> Route binding for `/api/hello`
--- global.css # -> Global styles
vite.config.js # -> Vite config
```

Only _`pages`_ and _`api`_ in the `src` folder hold special functionality, everything else will be processed 
like another javascript/typescript file.
